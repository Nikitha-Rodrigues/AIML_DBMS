It does not do well to dwell on dreams and forget to live.To the well-organized mind,death is but the next great adventure.It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies,but just as much to stand up to our friends.If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand,it is love.He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark.Not a scar,no visible sign.To have been loved so deeply,even though the person who loved us is gone,will give us some protection forever.It is in your very own skin.It is our choices,Harry,that show what we truly are,far more than our abilities.Happiness can be found,even in the darkest of times,if one only remembers to turn on the light.You think the dead we loved truly ever leave us?It is a curious thing, Harry,but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it.Those who,like you,have leadership thrust upon them,and take up the mantle because they must,and find to their own surprise that they wear it well.Do not pity the dead,Harry.Pity the living,and, above all,those who live without love
